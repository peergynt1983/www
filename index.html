          <p>Born in 1983, Grzegorz Stefański graduated from the Faculty of Philosophy at the Jagiellonian University in Cracow, Poland and Photography  at Art University in Poznań, Poland. In 2016 he graduated from Mirosław Balka’s Studio of Spatial Activities  at the Fine Arts Academy in Warsaw.  In 2016 he received Felix Slade Award to undertake MFA degree at Slade School of Art in London.  He lives and works in London and Warsaw.</p>

          <p>He creates cinematic and photographic projects as well as delegated performances. Protagonists of
his works are introduced to space between private and public. In his works he deals with identity,
relations and mimesis. He blurs the boundaries between documentary and fiction (restraint, 2016)
and by using memory as an archive of identity, he questions differences between facts and fiction (doover,
2016; Paul, 2015). His visual aesthetic is simple and often reductionistic.
He made his debut in 2010 with solo exhibition emptybottles in Goldex-Poldex Gallery in Cracow,
Poland. Since then his works were presented e.g. during Manifesta 11 in Zurich (2016), in MoMa
PS1 in New York (2010), in The New Theatre in Warsaw (2016), in Pastificio Cerere Foundation in
Rome (20114), in Ethnographic Museum in Warsaw (2015) and during Wro Media Art Bienalle in
Wrocław (2015).</p>

          <p>Grzegorz Stefański concentrates in his works on the relation between the aesthetic, the abstract and the cognitive experience of photography. In situations arranged by himself, he records the things that happen beyond the controlled intention to&nbsp;extract meaning in a&nbsp;photographic representation. Stefański asks about the possibility to&nbsp;locate photography between the literal character of the image of the world and the image that shifts the burden of gaze and elaborating on it onto the viewer.</p>

          <p>In his project Go-See, he continues the reflection on mechanical observation, which is seemingly unreflective and unconscious. In his work New Face, which preceded the project, the artist arranged a&nbsp;quasi-documentary situation based on an uncomfortable relation with a&nbsp;person sitting directly in front of the camera. Captured on video, women’s faces focused their gaze on something that evidently attracted their attention. Only after a&nbsp;moment did the viewer realise that the rustle heard from short distance was actually the sound of a&nbsp;porn film, which formed part of the arranged situation. In that work, we were dealing with a&nbsp;voyeuristic scene where devouring the image was dampened and paradoxically indifferent. In Go-See, we are confronted with a&nbsp;similar scheme of shortened distance and strong feedback between the observing and the observed. Models in front of the camera are not entangled in voracious, lecherous and infantile fashion photography, which is synonymous with an object of three practices: doing, being subordinated to&nbsp;something, watching. In this context, we are dealing with a&nbsp;reversed situation where photographs shown in a&nbsp;condensed form tear the humdrum process of posing and recording out of complete lethargy. In the project Go-See, the artist’s gaze is intentionally mechanical, and for this reason the process of portraying accidental and unintended gestures does not discriminate anything. It is also a&nbsp;method of operation on a&nbsp;portrait, overturning its classic form. On the other hand, it is also a&nbsp;critique full of ambiguities because we are witnessing here a&nbsp;delicate shift of meanings that refer to&nbsp;tropes related to&nbsp;the contemporary pop cultural category of beauty. Apart from a&nbsp;camera, which takes photos upon self-activation, Stefański uses a&nbsp;video camera, which carefully documents everything that happens in a&nbsp;completely darkened room. The narration which is thus introduced guarantees a&nbsp;rupture with the illusory character of theatrical, manneristic and often pretentious relations. In this configuration, the series of systematic and automatic photographs starts to&nbsp;acquire a&nbsp;clearly performative character. In Stefański’s project, the camera highlights the alienating character of sight, which is dominated in this case by an analytical and critical outlook on the problem of seemingly flawless, rational and purely descriptive portrait photography.</p>
