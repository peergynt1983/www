          <p>In his latest photographic and video
          projects Grzegorz Stefański introduces suspension
          of epistemology. He does not accept
          current state of reality and artificially creates
          situations at the nexus of psychology, philosophy
          and ethics. In his observations he employs
          art under the least obligation to answer
          “serious” questions which, paradoxically, provides
          those very answers. What is common
          about all Stefański’s works is voyeurism as
          knowledge device. We watch female models
          in darkness. Deprived of any physical observer,
          they automatically transform from subjects
          to objects. They are in fact observed
          by a mechanical camera that registers young
          women’s behaviour in complete darkness.
          The camera does not attract interest of women
          professionally working with their appearance.
          They very quickly stop performing their
          aesthetic social function and shed their mask. Does this resignation result from absence
          of physical observer or rather</p>

          <p> from loosening social rules because of their “invisibility”?
          Photographs taken at different time intervals
          can answer these, and many other, questions.
          The role of these pictures is significant despite
          mechanical repetition of frame. There
          are subtle differences that allow an insightful
          reflection on models’ behaviour. An identical
          laboratory device, mechanical observation,
          is used in other projects (<i>New Face</i> or
          the <i>212/62</i>). The artist verifies models as a
          function and social “model”. Under physical
          strain of endless dancing or invited to watch
          full-length porn film, they undergo empirical
          catharsis; from controlled social form to crisis
          to absolute decline. Grzegorz Stefański is
          aware that only somebody who uses image for
          constructing their identity can encourage the
          reflection ton epistemology by offering an alternative
          image. Realism in this respect plays
          a key role and enriched with objective laboratorial
          methodology becomes non-negatable.</p>

          <p>Grzegorz Stefański concentrates in his works on the relation between the aesthetic, the abstract and the cognitive experience of photography. In situations arranged by himself, he records the things that happen beyond the controlled intention to&nbsp;extract meaning in a&nbsp;photographic representation. Stefański asks about the possibility to&nbsp;locate photography between the literal character of the image of the world and the image that shifts the burden of gaze and elaborating on it onto the viewer.</p>

          <p>In his project Go-See, he continues the reflection on mechanical observation, which is seemingly unreflective and unconscious. In his work New Face, which preceded the project, the artist arranged a&nbsp;quasi-documentary situation based on an uncomfortable relation with a&nbsp;person sitting directly in front of the camera. Captured on video, women’s faces focused their gaze on something that evidently attracted their attention. Only after a&nbsp;moment did the viewer realise that the rustle heard from short distance was actually the sound of a&nbsp;porn film, which formed part of the arranged situation. In that work, we were dealing with a&nbsp;voyeuristic scene where devouring the image was dampened and paradoxically indifferent. In Go-See, we are confronted with a&nbsp;similar scheme of shortened distance and strong feedback between the observing and the observed. Models in front of the camera are not entangled in voracious, lecherous and infantile fashion photography, which is synonymous with an object of three practices: doing, being subordinated to&nbsp;something, watching. In this context, we are dealing with a&nbsp;reversed situation where photographs shown in a&nbsp;condensed form tear the humdrum process of posing and recording out of complete lethargy. In the project Go-See, the artist’s gaze is intentionally mechanical, and for this reason the process of portraying accidental and unintended gestures does not discriminate anything. It is also a&nbsp;method of operation on a&nbsp;portrait, overturning its classic form. On the other hand, it is also a&nbsp;critique full of ambiguities because we are witnessing here a&nbsp;delicate shift of meanings that refer to&nbsp;tropes related to&nbsp;the contemporary pop cultural category of beauty. Apart from a&nbsp;camera, which takes photos upon self-activation, Stefański uses a&nbsp;video camera, which carefully documents everything that happens in a&nbsp;completely darkened room. The narration which is thus introduced guarantees a&nbsp;rupture with the illusory character of theatrical, manneristic and often pretentious relations. In this configuration, the series of systematic and automatic photographs starts to&nbsp;acquire a&nbsp;clearly performative character. In Stefański’s project, the camera highlights the alienating character of sight, which is dominated in this case by an analytical and critical outlook on the problem of seemingly flawless, rational and purely descriptive portrait photography.</p>
